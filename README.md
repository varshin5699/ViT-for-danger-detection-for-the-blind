# Danger Detection using Vision Transformers

## Overview

This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals by leveraging Vision Transformers (ViT) for real-time danger detection on the road. The system processes input from a camera feed and identifies potential hazards such as obstacles, vehicles, or pedestrians. The Vision Transformers model is powered by the Hugging Face library, providing robust and efficient deep learning capabilities.

## Features

- **Vision Transformers (ViT):** State-of-the-art deep learning model for image recognition and feature extraction.
  
- **Roboflow Dataset:** The model is trained on a curated dataset from Roboflow, ensuring diverse and comprehensive data for accurate danger detection.

- **Real-time Detection:** The system performs danger detection in real-time, making it a valuable tool for assisting visually impaired individuals during navigation.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.10
- Hugging Face Transformers Library
- OpenCV


Install the required dependencies using:
